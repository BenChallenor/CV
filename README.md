## Benjamin Robert Challenor

I am a creative junior full-stack developer who recently graduated from Makers Academy, Europes leading Web Development bootcamp in April 2018. After many years in retail I needed a new challenge and a change to my career path. I chose to become a developer because of my passion for creating things and I find solving problems gives me an enormous sense of achievement. I'm now looking for the opportunity to use the skills I've developed to increase my skillset and continue my learning.

## Skills

#### Communication

* Throughout my time at Makers Academy pair-programming and giving feedback was essential to my learning. Weekly retrospectives and group stand ups were a chance to voice any ideas and concerns.
* Over ten years in retail has taught me the importance of great customer service. My role included daily staff meetings, recruitment, mentoring and scheduling.

#### Creativity

* I have always been a creative person. I have been a freelance illustrator since 2000, creating innovative images to communicate visual ideas on a wide range of subject matter.
* The skills learnt during my time at Makers Academy has given me the platform to unlock and realise all my creative ideas.

#### Learning

* Makers Academy wasn't about leaning as many languages and frameworks as possible, it taught me the skills how to learn. I'm now confident in approaching new ideas and technologies.
* I have a constant need to learn new things. Whether learning a new programming language to create a new project to understanding new computer software in order to aid my illustration.
