## Benjamin Robert Challenor

I am a creative junior full-stack developer who recently graduated from Makers Academy, a Web Development bootcamp in April 2018. After many years in retail management I needed a new challenge and a change to my career path. I am also a successful freelance illustrator, with clients including The Times and Conde Nast. I chose to become a developer because of my passion for creating things and I find solving problems gives me an enormous sense of achievement. I'm now looking for the opportunity to use my creativity and the skills I've developed to continue my learning in a developer role.

## Skills

#### Communication

* Throughout my time at Makers Academy pair-programming and giving feedback was essential to my learning. Weekly retrospectives and group stand ups were a chance to voice any ideas and concerns.
* Over ten years in retail has taught me the importance of great customer service. My role included daily staff meetings, recruitment, mentoring and scheduling.

#### Creativity

* I have always been a creative person. I have been a freelance illustrator since 2000, creating innovative images to communicate visual ideas on a wide range of subject matter.
* The skills learnt during my time at Makers Academy has given me the platform to unlock and realise all my creative ideas.

#### Learning

* Makers Academy wasn't about leaning as many languages and frameworks as possible, it taught me the skills how to learn. I'm now confident in approaching new ideas and technologies.
* I have a constant need to learn new things. When given the chance to work on group projects at Makers Academy I always used it as an opportunity to learn a new technology. The first example being able to explore Node.js in a project to recreate AirBNB.
